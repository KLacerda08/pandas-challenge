Late Submission Note - Pandas HW: 

My code ran well, with all the required results and I thought it was ready on time. However, just before the submittal deadline,
I made some last minute changes to clean it up.  I reran it from the start to confirm it still worked, and then I noticed that 
something in the lattter part of the code was rewriting certain dataframe results outputs in the earlier part of the code 
(adding columns that were not supposed to be there yet). 

It took me about 2.5 hours to troubleshoot this, which resulted in a late assignment. 

Things I learned: 
1 - When you use a dataframe later in the code and add columns, it permanently changes the dataframe, so if you are referencing
	that dataframe earlier in the code, output from that dataframe may be affected when you rerun it. 
2 - To get around this, I used the copy function (df2 = df1.copy()), and used the copy of that dataframe to perform 
	calculations later on in the code.
